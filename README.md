## git
The project includes sub repositories, therefore you have to use the following command to clone everything

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:mx-car/firmware.git
```
The command above will clone a specific version of the sub-repository. If you like to get the newest repo you have to go to the sub-repository folder and call `git pull origin master`.
